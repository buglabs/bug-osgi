This package contains the scripts for building Bug Labs java end-user tools.

com.buglabs.bug.emulator.xml
	The Virtual Bug and module emulation packages

com.buglabs.dragonfly.xml
	The BUG SDK Eclipse plug-in. 
	Depends on com.buglabs.bug.emulator and will build it if it doesn't find it.
	
com.buglabs.osgi.concierge.xml
	Concierge, the light OSGi runtime for BUG
	
com.buglabs.sdk.xml
	The all of the above wrapped up with Eclipse for instant install.
	Currently uses Eclipse 3.5 and builds for all platforms, linux, windows, mac
	NOTE: This build requires versions of eclipse in a certain format (zipped) 
		in certain folders on the build machine, usually the builder's home dir.
		Please see the "get_eclipse" target to see where it looks
		
		
Other Prerequisites

* linux build machine
* eclipse v3.5 as a tarball file called eclipse-lin.tar.gz in ~/com.eclipse.sdk/ on build machine
* other versions of eclipse for full sdk build.  See notes under com.buglabs.sdk.xml.
* ant-contrib & svnant -- See common.xml where it loads these tasks to see where it looks.

* Check out build project: svn co svn://svn.buglabs.net/dragonfly/trunk/com.buglabs.build and cd into the dir
* run and like this: ant -Dbuild.level=[integration, testing, or production] -f [build.xml file]
** For Example: ant -Dbuild.level=integration -f com.buglabs.sdk.xml
