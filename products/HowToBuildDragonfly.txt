1. Check out from svn the com.buglabs.build project
2. In Eclipse SDK workspace, do a search and replace to replace old M.m.r version with new version if you need to update the revision number. 
	a. You only need to do this for builds w/ substantial changes or bug fixes w/ some release notes attached
	b. check those changes in
3. Update version numbers and check paths in system.*.properties files
4. Update products/com.buglabs.dragonfly.buildnum if you need to.
	a. If it doesn't exist, you can copy com.buglabs.dragonfly.buildnum.sample and change the number
	b. OR if you're ok w/ buildnum = 0 (i.e. M.m.r.0) then when you build, the file will automatically be created w/ the build number = 0.
	c. If you need to update an existing plug-in, then this build num must be bigger than what you have.
	d. And the rub (defect) is if the build number is > 9, your jacked and you need to do step 2.
4. cd to products and do ./buildSDK <level>
	a.  i.e. ./buildSDK integration
	b.  You can also do ./buildAll if you're on darner (this also builds the full download).
